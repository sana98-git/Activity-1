# Activity-1
- Milestones group issues that are related to a particular goal, phase, or feature. This helps to organize and track the completion of tasks that are required to achieve that goal. They provide a way to set deadlines.
- GitHub Projects help teams to manage work by providing a structured way to organize tasks, track progress, and collaborate on issues and pull requests. Boards: Visual boards that display tasks in columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) to track the status of issues, pull requests, and other tasks
- An issue in GitHub can be related to one or more milestones, but typically, an issue is associated with only one milestone at a time. This association helps in tracking the progress of the issue in the context of that milestone’s objective.
- An issue can be related to multiple milestones sequentially (e.g. development of authentication system in milestone 1 "user authentication build", then milestone 2 " authentication system testing")
* Check the description of the issue, project,and milestone for better understanding
